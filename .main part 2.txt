Installer part 2:
Remove on the menu the prompt and replace it with the app list like it should do after installing

Execute first time config

First time config app:
Icon: :gear:

After finishing the setup process this app will be renamed as settings

Say if the app is still named setup
« Welcome to ReClyde! Let’s start by a simple configuration! »

Always say:
« Please select a date format \n The actual one is <insert date format>. \n Skip to not change it. »
After this step say
« Is the date correct? \n <insert the date ReClyde actually has>.
« Configuration done, pwny4OS is now all yours! »
Only show the date, not the time!

New app:
