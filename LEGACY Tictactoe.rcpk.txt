New app:
Name: Â«Â TicTacToeÂ Â»
When the app is opened you will start your messages like this: {ðŸŽ® TicTacToe | ReClyde}

It will just make the user play some TicTacToe

At the end of the game it will ask if the user wants to play again or exit
If the player chooses exit: exit the app and send him back to the home menu just like he used home command
